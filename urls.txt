Enable virtual Host and .htaccess(mod_rewrite) 
__________________________________________________

Navigate to "C:/xampp/apache/conf" or wherever your XAMPP files are located.
Open the file named ""httpd.conf" with a text editor.Uncomment line no 

# Virtual hosts
Include "conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf"

Uncomment line 130: (to enable .htaccess)

LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so



Make Virtual Host
___________________

First I am going to assume you’re using a Windows machine and have XAMPP installed.
Open the XAMPP control panel application and stop Apache. Be aware that late Windows machines might run it as a service, so check the box to the left of the Apache module.
Navigate to C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra or wherever your XAMPP files are located.
Open the file named httpd-vhosts.conf with a text editor.
Around line 19 find # NameVirtualHost *:80 and uncomment or remove the hash.
At the very bottom of the file paste the following code:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@codeigniter.local
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/codeigniter"
    ServerName codeigniter.local
    ErrorLog "C:/xampp/htdocs/codeigniter/error.log"
    CustomLog "C:/xampp/htdocs/codeigniter/access.log" combined
</VirtualHost>:

Restart Apache 


Make Host Entry into Windows
__________________________________________________

Next head over to your Windows host file to edit your HOSTS. 
This file will be located at C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts, where hosts is the file. Open it with notepad.
Look for
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost

127.0.0.1       localhost 
127.0.0.1       codeigniter.local

OR

127.0.0.1       localhost codeigniter.local

.htaccess file to remove index.ophp from urls in codeigniter
_______________________________________________________________


https://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/urls/remove_index.php.html

Create .htaccess file in root directory of your website (or copy it from application folder).

open the new .htaccess file and write this code into it.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /

        # Removes index.php from ExpressionEngine URLs
        RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^GET.*index\.php [NC]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/system/.* [NC]
        RewriteRule (.*?)index\.php/*(.*) /$1$2 [R=301,NE,L]

        # Directs all EE web requests through the site index file
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
